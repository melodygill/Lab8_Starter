# Lab 8 - Starter

Answers to lab questions:
1. I would fit automated tests in (1) within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This would allow me to see how each of my code changes affects the recipe site, in the actual environment where it is going to be hosted (Github Pages). Also, it would make testing my final deployment easy because the automated tests would run without me having to configure anything extra.
2. No because checking if a function is returning the correct output would be more suitable for a unit test.
